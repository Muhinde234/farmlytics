# Farmlytics Backend API

## Empowering Rwandan Farmers with Data-Driven Decisions

This repository contains the backend API for **Farmlytics**, a comprehensive agricultural intelligence platform designed to empower Rwandan farmers. By leveraging national agricultural and socio-economic datasets (SAS, EICV7, Establishment Census, Population Census), Farmlytics provides personalized crop planning, market connection insights, and harvest tracking to optimize agricultural productivity and market access.

## Setup & Installation

Follow these steps to get the Farmlytics backend running locally:

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Muhinde234/farmlytics.git
cd farmlytics-backend
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Prepare Data Files

Ensure your `data/` directory contains the cleaned and aggregated CSV files generated in the data preparation phase:

- `farmlytics_sas_production_cleaned_aggregated.csv`
- `farmlytics_eicv_consumption_cleaned_aggregated.csv`
- `farmlytics_establishment_census_cleaned_aggregated.csv`

The `analyticsService.js` loads these files on server startup.

### 4. Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root of the `farmlytics-backend` directory and add the following:

```plaintext
# Dotenv
PORT=5000
NODE_ENV=development

# MongoDB Configuration
MONGO_URI=mongodb+srv://<your_atlas_user>:<your_atlas_password>@cluster0.abcde.mongodb.net/farmlyticsdb?retryWrites=true&w=majority
# OR for local MongoDB: MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/farmlyticsdb

# JWT Configuration
JWT_SECRET=YOUR_VERY_STRONG_RANDOM_JWT_SECRET_KEY # CHANGE THIS IN PRODUCTION
JWT_EXPIRE=30d # e.g., 30 days

# Admin User Seeding (used on first server start if user doesn't exist)
ADMIN_EMAIL=admin@farmlytics.com
ADMIN_PASSWORD=strongadminpassword # CHANGE THIS IN PRODUCTION

# Email Service Configuration (for Nodemailer - e.g., Gmail)
EMAIL_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
EMAIL_PORT=587 # Use 465 for SSL, 587 for TLS
EMAIL_USER=your_sending_email@gmail.com 
EMAIL_PASS=your_app_password # IMPORTANT: For Gmail, use an App Password, not your main password!
NOREPLY_EMAIL=your_sending_email@gmail.com
SENDER_NAME="Farmlytics"

# Frontend URL (for email verification redirects)
BASE_FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:3000 # Replace with your frontend's actual URL
```

### 5. MongoDB Setup

#### For MongoDB Atlas:

- Ensure your cluster is running.
- Whitelist your application's IP address (or `0.0.0.0/0` for development, not recommended for production).
- Create a database user with readWrite access to the `farmlyticsdb` database.
- Replace `<your_atlas_user>` and `<your_atlas_password>` in `MONGO_URI` with your Atlas credentials.

#### For Local MongoDB:

- Ensure your MongoDB daemon (`mongod`) is running on your machine.

### 6. Start the Server

```bash
npm start
# Or for development with auto-reloading (if nodemon is installed):
# npm run dev
```

Upon successful startup, you should see messages like:

```
MongoDB Connected: ...
Initializing analytics services... All analytics services initialized successfully.
Server running in development mode on port 5000
Admin user seeded successfully. (or Admin user already exists. on subsequent runs)
```

## API Documentation (Swagger/OpenAPI)

Once the server is running, you can access the interactive API documentation:

- **Swagger UI:** Navigate to `http://localhost:5000/api-docs` in your web browser. Here, you can explore all endpoints, view schemas, and even send requests directly from the browser after authenticating.

---

##  Authentication & Authorization

Farmlytics employs JWT-based authentication and role-based authorization to secure its API.

### Roles:

- **admin:** Full access to all functionalities, including managing user accounts and viewing all crop plans.
- **farmer:** Can access crop recommendations, market insights, and manage their own crop plans.
- **buyer:** Can access market demand and market connection insights (buyers, processors, exporters).

### Email Verification:

New user registrations require email verification before they can log in. A verification link is sent to the registered email, which, when clicked, updates the user's `isVerified` status in the database.

### JWT Protection:

Most API routes are protected (using `protect` middleware), requiring a valid JWT in the `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header. Role-based authorization (using `authorize` middleware) further restricts access to specific roles.
